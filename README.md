# Building Blocks

Building Blocks is a voxel library that focuses on real-time applications.

Supported use cases include:

- sampling signed distance fields
- generating meshes
- pathfinding
- procedural generation

## Learning

The current best way to learn about the library is to read the documentation.
Clone the repo and run `cargo doc --open --all-features`. There is plentiful
documentation with examples.

To run the benchmarks (using the "criterion" crate), go to the root of a crate and run `cargo bench`.
